website.html -> This is my template html file. Everything can be changed (color, layout, tabs, etc). I included a login button so we can try ti link that. All of the css work was done inside the html file for simplicity, but if we need to make it a separate css file we can do that. This was done in vscode. Right now all the tabs go to nowhere,  but we can add html pages for them, for example about us or contact or how to play the game.
